#Vaccination Impact Before and After COVID-19 Visualization in Tableau

Data Visualization in Tableau to show the impact of vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic through different states of USA.

Used Tableau and Microsoft Excel to visualize data based on some ideas:
Tableau: US map with hot color where the virus is present more and cold color where the virus is not present more. 
Excel: Post completion of Data Cleaning, compared bar charts of all the states in the US with the number of deaths and positive cases before and after vaccination drive.


1.	Project Description: Describing the overall theme or Project Concept
Our project group concept is to show the impact of the vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the different states of the US. We are trying to show, how effective the vaccinations are in reducing the positive covid cases and deaths in different states of US.


2.	Objective: Why are you visualizing this?
We are visualizing this to see if the vaccine is effective to fight COVID-19. A lot of theories claim that the vaccine does not fight against COVID-19. If we can have a clear visualization of the evolution of the pandemic state by state, correlated to the evolution of the percentage of vaccinated people state by state, it would be a great way to have an objective view on the vaccine efficiency. Also, visualizing this evolution of the pandemic without the vaccine and with the vaccine makes it easier for people to have an overall point of view without knowing the number.


3.	Hypothesis: Explain the phenomenon of data considered in your proposed Data Visualization project.
Main Hypothesis: 
Is covid vaccination effective to fight Covid 19 in different states of United States of America?

Sub Hypotheses: 
Is covid vaccination reducing confirmed positive cases in different states of the US? 
Is covid vaccination reducing deaths in different states of the US?


4.	Data Sources: Provide the data link(s) for primary and secondary (if any)
Primary: State by state daily data on COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States

Secondary: State by state daily data of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths in the US.

5.	Number of Records: How many records in the data set?
Primary: 15,461 records before cleaning and 500 records after cleaning
Secondary: 63 404 records before cleaning and 2100 records after cleaning


6.	Visualization Tool: What visualization tool will you use? Why?
We are going to use “Tableau” and “Microsoft Excel” to visualize our data with some ideas below:
-	Tableau: US map with hot color where the virus is present more and cold color where the virus is not present more. 
-	Excel: Compare bar charts of all the states in the US with the number of deaths and positive cases before and after vaccination drive.
